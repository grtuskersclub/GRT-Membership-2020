<a id="history" class="anchor" href="#history" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>History:</h3>
<p>The team was found in 2018 when a group of passionate Cricket lovers who played together, decided to put together a team of their own. Its members are basically from Guelph, Cambridge, Waterloo , Kitchener and Fergus Ontario. We chose name of the river, "Grand River" that runs across these areas.
Why the name Tuskers? Our team was formed by members hailing from Kerala, a small and beautiful state in south India famous for its elephants, to symbolize the power of elephants we chose "Tuskers”. "Grand River Tuskers Sports Club“ was incorporated as a Not-for-Profit organization in 2019.</p>
